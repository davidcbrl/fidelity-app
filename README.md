## Build Runner: Built Value Generator Command

flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs


##1 - Installing Flutter
# clone flutter repo in a folder using the command: 
git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable

From the Start search bar, enter ‘env’ and select Edit environment variables for your account.
Under User variables check if there is an entry called Path:
If the entry exists, append the full path to flutter\bin using ; as a separator from existing values.
If the entry doesn’t exist, create a new user variable named Path with the full path to flutter\bin as its value.
You have to close and reopen any existing console windows for these changes to take effect.
